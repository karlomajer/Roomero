## About

This project was made with ReactJS, Node and MongoDB. The purpose of building this app was to get a better understanding of how the backend works but also to try out React hooks and JWT authentication.

## Getting Started

Inside the project's root folder, run:

```console
$ npm run setup
```

This will install all of the dependencies and build the development Tailwind CSS. After that's done, start the frontend and backend server with:

```console
$ npm run dev
```

The app is now running in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
